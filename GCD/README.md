To create a GCD circuit by Verilog.

This is my first Verilog project to exercise.

It reference [MIT_GCD](http://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.375/6_375_2006_www/handouts/lectures/L03-Verilog-Design-Examples.pdf) on page 11.

Two modifications:
	1.I changed the "SWAP" steps to "SWAP" function.
 	2.And not use the flag "done".
